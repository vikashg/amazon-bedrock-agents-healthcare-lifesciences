# Research agents for LifeSciences with Amazon Bedrock Agents

Explore the following components in the repository:
## Agents catalog
Library of specialized agents for different R&D workflows [agent-catalog](agents_catalog/)
## Multi-agent collaboration
Framework for agent collaboration and knowledge sharing. End to end example for cancer biomarker discovery [multi-agent](multi_agent_collaboration/cancer_biomarker_discovery/README.md)
## Evaluation
Methods for assessing agent performance and result quality. End to end example for cancer biomarker discovery [evaluations](evaluations/README.md)

## Deployment
### Note: You can choose to deploy the agents with one-click deployment or set them up yourself in workshop mode

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Access to Amazon Bedrock foundation models (not granted by default). To gain access, follow the [official documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-access.html).


1. Upload the `infra/Infra_cfn.yaml` file from the [amazon-bedrock-agents-cancer-biomarker-discovery](https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-bedrock-agents-cancer-biomarker-discovery) repository to AWS CloudFormation. This template will set up:
> [!WARNING]  
> Launching this stack will create 2 VPCs (Infrastructure and UI).

   - Networking infrastructure (VPC, Subnets, etc.)
   - Amazon Redshift database
   - Bedrock Agent with Actions
   - Knowledgebase
   - Streamlit UI frontend

2. Deploy the `Infra_cfn.yaml` template:
   - Default parameter values can remain unchanged
   - Parameter descriptions:
     - `BedrockModelId`: ID of the Foundation Model for the Agent (permissions scoped to Anthropic Claude 3 Sonnet model)
     - `EnvironmentName`: Differentiates the application if launched in the same AWS account (lowercase, one number, max 5 characters)
     - `RedshiftDatabaseName`: Name for the Redshift database
     - `RedshiftUserName`: Username for Redshift database login
     - `RedshiftPassword`: Password for Redshift database login
     - `GithubLink`: Default repository for the Agent (do not change)
     - `ImageTag`: Tag of the Docker image for Streamlit UI deployment

> [!NOTE]  
> Full deployment takes approximately 10-15 minutes. Stack can also be launched in us-east-1 or us-west-2 by clicking launch stack below

|   Region   | Infra_cfn.yaml |
| ---------- | ----------------- |
| us-east-1  | [![launch-stack](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudformation-examples/cloudformation-launch-stack.png)](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks/new?stackName=biomakeragent&templateURL=https://aws-blogs-artifacts-public.s3.amazonaws.com/artifacts/ML-16901/Infra_cfn.yaml)|
| us-west-2  | [![launch-stack](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudformation-examples/cloudformation-launch-stack.png)](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-west-2#/stacks/new?stackName=biomakeragent&templateURL=https://aws-blogs-artifacts-public.s3.amazonaws.com/artifacts/ML-16901/Infra_cfn.yaml)|

3. After stack launch is successful manually sync the Knowledgebase:
   1. Navigate to the Bedrock dashboard via AWS Console search
   2. Click the option icon (top left) to open the navigation bar
   3. Select "Knowledge bases" under the "Builder tools" tab
   4. Choose the Knowledgebase created by the CloudFormation template
   5. Scroll to the "Data Source" option box
   6. Select the data source (radio button) and click "Sync"

4. Access the UI:
   1. Navigate to AWS CloudFormation via AWS Console search
   2. Click the Streamlit nested stack (format: `<stackname>-StreamlitBuildNestedStack-<123ABCXXXX>`)
   3. In the Outputs tab, find the CloudFrontURL link and add 'https://' to the beginning of the URL and paste in your browser
