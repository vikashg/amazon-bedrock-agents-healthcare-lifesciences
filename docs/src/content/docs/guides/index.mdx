Welcome to the Amazon Bedrock Agents for Healthcare & Life Sciences (HCLS) contribution guide. This step-by-step tutorial will help you create your own domain-specific agent and contribute it to our growing catalog, as well as configure multiple agents to collaborate effectively.

import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have:

    - An AWS account with access to Amazon Bedrock

    - Requested access to the foundation models you plan to use with your agent

    - AWS CLI configured with appropriate permissions

    - Basic knowledge of AWS services and JSON/YAML configuration

    - Git and GitHub account (for contributing to the repository)

## Creating Your Own Bedrock Agent
- Review Bedrock Agent documentation to [build and modify agents](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/agents-build-modify.html)
- Review Bedrock Agent documentation to [deploy and integrate agents](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/agents-deploy.html)

<Tabs> <TabItem label="Using CloudFormation" icon="seti:aws" color="orange">

#### One-Click Deployment

1. Use the agent example that most closely matches your use case from our catalog
2. Alternatively, create your own using the cdk template located [here](https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-bedrock-samples/tree/main/agents-and-function-calling/bedrock-agents/features-examples/13-create-agent-using-CDK)
3. Wait for the stack deployment to complete (~5-10 minutes)
4. Access your agent through the AWS Bedrock console

#### Interactive Development

1. Clone the repository locally:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-bedrock-agents-healthcare-lifesciences.git
cd amazon-bedrock-agents-healthcare-lifesciences
```

2. Open the agents catalog and navigate to the folder to create your own agent:
```bash
cd create-your-own-agent
```

3. Select from the list of options 
   - Use default agent template
   - Bring your own data - SQL database
   - Bring your own data - RAG with documents
   - Bring your own data - Knowledge graph
   - Bring your own tool - lambda function
   - Bring your own tool - custom container
   - Bring your own tool - Foundation model inference with Amazon SageMaker

4. Follow the notebook cells to:
   - Configure your AWS credentials
   - Setup the pre-requisities for data and tools
   - Define your agent's purpose and behavior
   - Create action groups for API functionality
   - Connect knowledge bases for domain expertise
   - Test and refine your agent's responses

5. Save your configuration for later contribution. Provide agent description and documentation via Readme.md before submission.

#### Manual Configuration

1. Log in to the [AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/)
2. Navigate to Amazon Bedrock → Agents
3. Click "Create agent"
4. Configure the basic agent settings:
   - Name your agent
   - Select a foundation model (Claude, Titan, etc.)
   - Define instructions for your healthcare/life sciences use case
5. Add Action Groups:
   - Define API schema for domain-specific actions
   - Configure authentication and endpoints
6. Add Knowledge Bases:
   - Connect medical literature or documents
   - Configure retrieval settings
7. Test your agent in the console playground
8. Deploy when satisfied with performance

### Agent Configuration Best Practices for HCLS

When creating agents for healthcare and life sciences applications, consider these best practices:

    Instructions: Be specific about the HCLS domain expertise your agent should have
    Context window usage: Structure prompts efficiently to maximize available context
    Knowledge base optimization: Index documents strategically for relevant retrieval
    Action group design: Create focused, clear API schemas for  data operations
    Security and compliance: Follow data handling best practices. Use public data sources with appropriate license. 
    Testing: Validate responses with domain-specific test cases

Example agent instructions for a medical terminology agent:

You are a healthcare terminology expert specializing in standardized medical coding systems.
Your primary expertise includes ICD-10, SNOMED CT, LOINC, RxNorm, and CPT codes.

When responding to queries:
- Provide accurate code lookups when a description is provided
- Explain the meaning of codes when a code is provided
- Suggest related codes when appropriate
- Clarify ambiguities by asking follow-up questions
- Note version differences in coding systems when relevant
- Cite authoritative sources when possible

Do not:
- Provide medical advice or diagnosis
- Make claims about insurance coverage
- Guarantee coding accuracy for billing purposes
- Share information about specific patients

Use your knowledge bases to reference official coding manuals and guidelines.
Use API actions to look up specific codes when needed.

### Contributing Your Agent to the Catalog

Once you've created and tested your agent, follow these steps to contribute to our catalog:

    Fork the repository on GitHub

    Clone your fork locally:
   ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/amazon-bedrock-agents-healthcare-lifesciences.git
    cd amazon-bedrock-agents-healthcare-lifesciences
    git checkout multi-agent-collaboration

    #Create a new branch:

    git checkout -b add-my-agent-name
   ```
    Add your agent to the catalog:
        Create a new directory in agents_catalog/ with your agent's name
        Include the following files:
            README.md: Description, use cases, and setup instructions
            cloudformation/: Templates for one-click deployment
            notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for custom setup
            sample-prompts.md: Example interactions showing capabilities
            architecture.png: Visual diagram of your agent

    Submit a pull request:
        Go to the original repository
        Click "Pull Requests" → "New Pull Request"
        Select your fork and branch
        Complete the PR template with details about your agent
   

Our team will review your submission and provide feedback before merging.

## Configuring Multiple Agents in Collaboration

   ```bash
   git clone -b multi-agent-collaboration https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-bedrock-agents-healthcare-lifesciences.git
   cd amazon-bedrock-agents-healthcare-lifesciences/multi_agent_orchestration
   ```

2. Review the directory structure to understand the components:
   ```
   multi_agent_orchestration/
   ├── templates/            # CloudFormation templates
   ├── examples/             # Example implementations
   └── README.md             # Documentation
   ```

4. Follow the notebook cells in the example notebook to:
   - Configure your AWS credentials
   - Setup the pre-requisities for sub-agents
   - Define your supervisor agent's purpose and behavior 
   - Select Supervisor mode or Supervisor with router mode 
   - Associate the list of agents
   - Test and refine your supervisor agent's responses

5. Save your configuration for later contribution. Provide agent description and documentation via Readme.md before submission.
